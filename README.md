# Government-Scheme-Eligibility-Application-Tracking-System

**Project Description**

The Government Schemes Application Management System is a role-based web application designed to digitize and manage the complete lifecycle of government scheme applications. The system provides a structured platform where applicants can submit applications, officers can verify them, and administrators can manage schemes and users.
The objective of this project is to ensure transparency, proper workflow management, and secure handling of applications instead of acting as a simple form-filling portal.

**Problem Statement**

Existing government portals often function only as application submission platforms and lack proper tracking, verification workflows, and role separation. Applicants are unable to clearly monitor their application status, and officers do not have structured tools for verification and decision-making.
This project addresses these limitations by implementing a workflow-driven backend system with clearly defined responsibilities for each user role.

**User Roles and Access Control**
1) **Applicant**
   - Register and login to the system
   - Create and manage personal profile
   - Apply for available government schemes
   - Upload required documents
   - Track application status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

2) **Officer**
   - Login securely
   - View assigned applications
   - Verify applicant details and submitted documents
   - Approve or reject applications
   - Add remarks or rejection reasons

3) **Admin**
   - Create, update, and manage government schemes
   - Manage users and assign roles
   - Assign applications to officers
   - Monitor overall system activity

**Application Workflow**

1) Applicant submits an application
2) Application status is set to Pending
3) Officer verifies the application and documents
4) Application is Approved or Rejected
5) Applicant can track status at every stage
